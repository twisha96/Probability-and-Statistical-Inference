# Bootstrapping (Statistics)

Bootstrapping is a random sampling technique which allows estimation of the sampling distribution of almost any statistic. This assignment covers :    

1. Building a bias, standard deviation, and confidence interval estimator for the mean based on the bootstrap (use 10000 = nboot) and the jackknife.   
2. Building a simulator that draws n samples from a lognormal distribution (rlnorm) and builds both the central limit theorem based confidence interval, and compares it to the coverage rate for the 3 bootstrap and the jackknife normal based confidence interval (with bias correction) (confidence interval based on the 1st program). (1000 simulation runs minimum) for:   
	a. Normal approximation.  
	b. Pivotal CI.  
3. Compare the coverage rates for the bootstrap confidence interval, the jackknife normal approximation confidence interval and the central limit theorem based confidence interval. For sample sizes 10, 30, and 100 alpha=0.05 (95% confidence).  
4. For the standard deviation of the normal distribution, estimate the bias of the sample standard deviation when dividing by n, compare the bootstrap and the jackknife (1000 simulations).

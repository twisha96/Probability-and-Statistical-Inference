# Breast Cancer Data Analysis and Classification  

In this project, statistical analysis and classification of [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)) is done.    

For Statistical analysis, correlation and distribution of features are visualised using R libraries of heatmaply_cor and ggpairs. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to reduce the number of features form original count of 30.    

Based on the data attributes, the cancer is classified into malignant or benign using the methods of:   
1. Logistic Regression.  
2. Naive Bayes.   
3. Decision Trees.  
4. Random Forest.  

The results of the classification are evaluated using the metrics of:  
1. Accuracy.  
2. Precision.  
3. Recall.

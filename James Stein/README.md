# James Stein Estimator 

Risks of the James Stein estimator vs Maximum Likelihood estimator (MLE) Estimator for $\theta$ are compared, which is a k-dimensional vector.    

The risk (estimated mean square errors) of both the estimators are compared as the dimension of $\theta$ ranges from k = 1 to 100. The k-dimensional vector essentially is the mean vector of the k-variate normal random variable. The variance is taken as 1. First, a K-dimensional vector of mean ùú≠ as zero is generated. Second, 1000 samples for each random variable ~ N($\theta$<sub>k</sub>, 1) is generated/. We thus estimate the MLE estimator, James-stein estimator and the corresponding risks from these observations.
